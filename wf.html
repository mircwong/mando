			01. Project Overview
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			<b><span style = "color:#95C623;">Wells Fargo</span></b> is an American, multinational financial services company that
			provides banking, mortgage, investing, credit card, and personal, small
			business, and commercial financial services. The Wells Fargo mobile app
			allows clients to manage finances, make deposits, transfer funds, and pay bills.
			Within this past year, Wells Fargo has taken the first steps to rebranding
			themselves after recovering from their infamous bank scandal. They’ve slightly
			updated their logo, featuring a more bold and modern red hue as well as a new
			graphic design treatment for their wagon visual.
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
		 	Despite this update in brand identity,
			their mobile app has yet to be modernized. The current design is quite
			dated in terms of interface and usability, making it complicated for users to
			navigate through and quickly find what they need. <b><span style = "color:#95C623;">The purpose of this redesign
			is to simplify and streamline navigation of the app, focus its layout around the most
			interaction-heavy features, and update the interface to increase user engagement</span></b>.
		</div>

		<div class="process-step">
			02. User Research
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			User Interviews
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			I conducted interviews with a wide range of people, from college
			students to working professionals. I wanted to identify the common pain
			points users face when interacting with the Wells Fargo mobile app as well
		 	as their own individual bank’s. To understand the needs and priorities of
			my audience, I asked a series of questions while users interacted with the current app.

			<div class="question-title">
				How would you describe your inital experience using this app?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				What are you thinking while trying to navigate through it?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				What are your thoughts on its layout and design?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				What, if anything, caused you frustration?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				How might you improve its design and usability?
			</div>

			<div class="img">
				<img src="images/WellsFargo/WF-interviews.png" alt="wf-interviews">
			</div>
			After talking to users and understanding their experiences and needs, I was
			able to solidify the most common obstacles they encounter and pinpoint the
			features that were the most interaction-heavy.

			Primary Concerns
		</div>
						<div class="two-column">
							<div class="left-side">
								<div class="subtitle">○  Unclear Naming Conventions</div>
                            Naming conventions are too broad, which is
														confusing and tedious to navigate through
														<br>
														<br>
													 	Users waste time jumping through many screens due to misleading naming conventions
														<br>
														<br>
														Want to ease the language a bit more because banking jargon can
														be frustrating for new users
								<div class="subtitle">○  Cluttered Navigation</div>
														Not intuitive, too many ways to accomplish goals
														<br>
														<br>
														Navigation feels cluttered, lacks solid structure and consistency
                </div>

								<div class="right-side">
									<div class="subtitle">○  Outdated Interface</div>
														There are little to no visual cues that help direct users where to go
														<br>
														<br>
														Heavily dependent on language for signals

					<div class="subtitle">○  Account Summary</div>
					Lays out all accounts on one screen

			<div class="step-title">
				Redefine Key Features
			</div>
			<div class="step-desc">
				Based on the research I collected from the interviews, I've more clearly defined
				the key features that I want to highlight in this redesign and that I believe are the most
				significant to the function of the app. I've renamed some features to simplify the original
				naming conventions.
			</div>
			<div class="two-column">
				<div class="left-side">
					<div class="subtitle">○  Account Summary</div>
					I've chosen to keep this feature the same as it is functional and easy to locate
					<div class="subtitle">○  Transfer & Pay</div>
					The original Transfer Money feature had several different screens that accomplished the same goal of
					 transferring money from or making payments to either the same Wells Fargo account, as well as allowing
					 customers to send money through Zelle
					 <br>
					 <br>
					I've created one screen that accomplishes transferring money within Wells Fargo accounts and created
					a separate feature for sending money through Zelle
					<div class="subtitle">○  Deposit</div>
					I've chosen to keep this feature the same as it is functional and easy to locate, but I've simplified its name
				</div>
				<div class="right-side">
					<div class="subtitle">○  Send</div>
					Allows users to send money through Zelle
					<br>
					<br>
					This original feature was housed under the Transfer Money feature in the original app design
					and I've made it its own feature so users can find it more easily and don't have to parse through
					Transfer Money to get there
					<div class="subtitle">○  Alerts</div>
					I've combined the original Message Center and Manage Alerts features into one
			</div>

			Task Flow
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			I've determined which tools and criteria are the most essential and
			created a task flow diagram to illustrate a more streamlined navigation across all processes within this app.

			04. Prototyping
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Wireframes
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			I took the key features and translated them into simple wireframes. I was mainly focused on
			exploring different layouts that highlighted the most interaction-heavy items and best
			displayed the information to the user.

		<div class="step-title">
			User Testing
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			In order to assess the new design’s friendliness and usability, I had 4 people from ages 20 to 55
			 test out these wireframes. I gave each individual the same set of tasks to accomplish and had each of
			  them walk through their user flow.
		</div>

		<div class="two-column">
			<div class="left-side">
				<div class="subtitle">○  4 users</div>
										1 new user
										<br>
										<br>
										2 frequent users
										<br>
										<br>
										1 infrequent user
				</div>
				<div class="right-side">
					<div class="subtitle">○  3 Tasks</div>
										1. Transfer money from your Savings to Checking account

										<br>
										2. Check to see if you have any notifications or messages

				<div class="subtitle">User Testing Results</div>
					<div class="subtitle-span">
						<b><span style = "color:#95C623;">4</span>/4</b> users were able to navigate to the Transfer & Pay card and begin the transfer
						<br>
						<br>
						<b><span style = "color:#95C623;">4</span>/4</b> users were able to check their notifications and noted that the yellow “alert”
						circle on the hamburger icon signaled how to get there
						<br>
						<br>
						<b><span style = "color:#95C623;">4</span>/4</b> users were able to navigate to their credit card page and found the “View statements” button
						<br>
						<br>
						<b><span style = "color:#95C623;">I observed how each individual navigated through the design and was able to note down minor, common areas of confusion and difficulty:</span></b>

						<div class="two-column">
							<div class="left-side">
								<div class="subtitle">○  Small text size</div>
														When older users were examining the screen layouts, they noted that it was difficult to see the text clearly, especially
														in areas with multiple lines of text
														<br>
														<br>
														They also expressed that some subtext, for example, "available balance," was easily overlooked given its light font weight and size
								<div class="subtitle">○  Need for a "help" button</div>
														2/4 users expressed that it might be helpful to have a "help" button somewhere convenient, especially for long-time users who
														are used to the old design and are trying to get acclamated to the updated version.
								</div>
								<div class="right-side">
									<div class="subtitle">○  Small icon size</div>
														Similar to the small text size, 3/4 users noted that the icon sizes might be too small and could be increased for better visibility
								</div>

						High-Fidelty Prototype
					</div>
					<div class="step-desc">
						After discussing with the same people I interviewed and receiving feedback, I was able to create more structured and effective layouts of the simple wireframes.
						I also concentrated on implementing the Wells Fargo color palette in a purposeful and consistent way.
