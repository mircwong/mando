			01. Project Overview
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			Wells Fargo is an American, multinational financial services company that
			provides banking, mortgage, investing, credit card, and personal, small
			business, and commercial financial services. The Wells Fargo mobile app
			allows clients to manage finances, make deposits, transfer funds, and pay bills.
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			Within this past year, Wells Fargo has taken the first steps to rebranding
			themselves after recovering from their infamous bank scandal. They’ve slightly
			updated their logo, featuring a more bold and modern red hue as well as a new
			graphic design treatment for their wagon visual. The purpose of this redesign
			is to simplify navigation of the app and center its layout around the most
			interaction-heavy features.
		</div>
		<div class="question-title">
			How might we improve our mobile banking experience to meet our needs?
		</div>

		<div class="process-step">
			02. User Research
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			User Interviews
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			I conducted interviews with a wide range of people, from college
			students to working professionals. I wanted to identify the common pain
			points users face when interacting with the Wells Fargo mobile app as well
		 	as their own individual bank’s.
			<div class="img">
				<img src="images/WellsFargo/WF-interviews.png" alt="wf-interviews">
			</div>
			After talking to users and understanding their experiences and needs, I was
			able to solidify the most common obstacles they encounter and pinpoint the
			features that were the most interaction-heavy.

			Primary Concerns
		</div>
						<div class="two-column">
							<div class="left-side">
								<div class="subtitle">+ Unclear Naming Conventions</div>
                            —Naming conventions are too broad, which is
														confusing and tedious to navigate through
														<br>
													 	—Users must gothrough many screens to get to where they want to be
														<br>
														—Want to ease the language a bit more because banking jargon can
														be frustrating for new users
								<div class="subtitle">+ Cluttered Navigation</div>
														—Not intuitive, too many ways to accomplish goals
														<br>
														—Navigation feels cluttered, lacks solid structure and consistency
                </div>

								<div class="right-side">
									<div class="subtitle">+ Outdated Interface</div>
														—There are little to no visual cues that help direct users where to go
														<br>
														—Heavily dependent on language for signals

			<div class="step-title">
				Redefine Key Features
			</div>
			<div class="step-desc">
				Based on the research I collected from the interviews, I've more clearly defined
				the key features that I want to highlight in this redesign and that I believe are the most
				significant to the function of the app. I've renamed some features to simplify the original
				naming conventions.
			</div>
			<div class="two-column">
				<div class="left-side">
					<div class="subtitle">+ Account Summary</div>
					—I've chosen to keep this feature the same as <br> it is functional and easy to locate
					<div class="subtitle">+ Transfer & Pay</div>
					—The original Transfer Money feature had <br> several different screens that accomplished the same goal of
					 transferring money from or <br> making payments to either the same Wells <br> Fargo account, as well as allowing
					 customers to <br>send money through Zelle
					 <br>
					—I've created one screen that accomplishes transferring money within Wells Fargo accounts and created
					a separate feature for sending money through Zelle
					<div class="subtitle">+ Deposit</div>
					—I've chosen to keep this feature the same as it is functional and easy to locate, but I've simplified its name
				</div>
				<div class="right-side">
					<div class="subtitle">+ Send</div>
					—Allows users to send money through Zelle
					<br>
					—This original feature was housed under the Transfer Money feature in the original app design
					and I've made it its own feature so users can find it more easily and don't have to parse through
					Transfer Money to get there
					<div class="subtitle">+ Alerts</div>
					—I've combined the original Message Center and Manage Alerts features into one

			Task Flow
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			I've determined which tools and criteria are the most essential and
			created a task flow diagram to illustrate a more streamlined navigation across all processes within this app.
