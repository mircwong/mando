			<h6> I'm Miranda, a senior at the <a target=”_blank” href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a>
				double majoring in Design and Managerial Economics. I'm an experience and interaction designer interested in designing for public good and to make a greater impact.
				I am currently VP Education + a Design Consultant at <a target=”_blank” href="https://davisdi.org/">Design Interactive,</a> UC Davis’ first student-run human-centered design consultancy. Our teams tackle client-based design projects every quarter and run studios and workshops for students interested in user experience.
				In June, my team and I completed our redesign of the mobile app at <a target=”_blank” href="https://parkjapa.com/">JAPA,</a> a smart parking service.
				<br>
				<br>
				I am also a Design Intern at <a target=”_blank” href="https://research.ucdavis.edu/offices/vc/">Venture Catalyst</a>, a branch of the UC Davis Office of Research that facilitates the translation of university research and technology
				by driving the development of new ventures. I work with researchers and innovators launching new startups in the biopharma and biotech industry through UC Davis to design
				strategic branding, which include logos, signage, pitchdecks, etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				My journey began in high school, where I designed custom t-shirts for my friends, sports teams, and student organizations on campus. ‍
				Even though it was just a hobby, it's what got me curious about what design could do for people. I've learned that what I love about design is that it's extremely versatile and
				ubiquitous and I think there's a lot of power in that; power that should be used for good. 💖
	      <br>
 				<br>
				I seek a deep understanding of the world, both
				the good and the bad, and hope to be able to make it better.
				As I learn more about people, society, and systems,
				I desire sincerity and honesty in all facets of my life and hope to apply those qualities to my work.
