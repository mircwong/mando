				<div class="storyline-title">The Story</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
					My team and I were challenged to build off of the current JAPA app and create an improved, new design.

					The main objective was to <b>redesign the entire app</b> to provide users with a <b>smooth and pleasant experience</b> while keeping in mind <b>scalability and future feature integrations.</b>

		<div class="problem-space-container">
				<div class="small-process-title">Problem Space</div>
				<div class="main-step-title">What is the current parking experience like and why is it a problem?</div>
						<div class="step-description">
							Before the COVID-19 spread, people had places to be and time was of the essence. Just when they thought they had enough problems,
							looking for parking took its place on the neverending list. Simply put, parking is challenging. Lots and garages are often very crowded,
							regulations and pricing can‚Äôt be determined until arrival, and the time spent looking for parking is unpredictable. Because of these reasons,
							drivers are forced to leave their house earlier to account for time spent searching for a space and bounce between parking facilities that are full.
							Drivers are left frustrated and now they‚Äôre late for their commitments.

		<div class="current-experience-title">So how is JAPA tackling this problem?</div>
		This is what the current app experience looks like. In this quick demo, the user is looking for the Southwest Parking Lot and
		checking the real-time space availability.

<div class="problem-container">
		<div class="small-text-title">Problem</div>
		<div class="problem-title">Given the platform is available in many frequented and heavily populated locations, why aren‚Äôt users engaging with the app?</div>
				<div class="problem-description">
					While JAPA fills the need for a real-time guidance platform that provides users with parking options and reliable,
					live information and updates, the app is more focused on simple functionality than catering toward a variety of needs and fostering an
					emotional or personal connection with users.

<div class="opportunity-container">
		<div class="small-text-title">Space for opportunity</div>
		<div class="problem-title">What if we designed around the user‚Äôs personal narrative and real parking experience to guide them through using the app?</div>
</div>



<div class="solution-container">
		<div class="storyline">
				<div class="storyline-title">The Solution</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
				We designed a set of new features within the JAPA app that supports a much wider range of needs. The new design takes new and returning users on a more controlled,
				personalized journey and uses unique features such as the map quick look to list view, filtering, and garage level card swipe to guide drivers smoothly to their destination.
				By integrating these features and mimicking the in-app journey to the external parking experience, JAPA creates a more full, guided experience for users and builds a more
				lasting relationship with them.
