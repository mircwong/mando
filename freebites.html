		In addition to our design team syncs, we also met with Kim (Co-founder) and Minhee (Engineer)

		<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		Overall, this was a very collaborative and smooth process. By the end of our 6 weeks, we
		shipped our designs off to FreeBites and Kim was extremely impressed with our work.

		<div class="right-title">What is FreeBites?</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			FreeBites is a community-based food sharing platform that leverages technology to reroute
			excess food to where it can be eaten instead of wasted. It makes it possible for folks to
			discover free food and share surplus food wherever they are and builds an inclusive, cooperative,
			 and local food ecosystem among neighbors, local restaurants, and non-profits.

			<div class="right-title">Why a redesign? 🔥</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			While there are a number of reasons FreeBites called for a redesign, the 2 main reasons are that
			the current design isn't optimized for all user types and FreeBites wants to shift from a
			campus-based platform to a community-focused one.

			<div class="right-title">Directed Onboarding</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			After opening the app, new users are prompted to create an account
			by entering their phone number, name, vehicle information, and preferred payment method.
			This serves to make all future parking experiences simpler, such as
			paying for parking and identifying where they last parked.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/sign-in-gif.gif" alt="sign in gif">
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Once finished or skipped, users can choose to learn how to use the app
			in 6 simple onboarding steps.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/onboarding-gif.gif" alt="onboarding gif">
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Payment Settings</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Entering their payment information allows for future integration
			of an in-app parking ticket payment system. Users can easily make
			purchases and keep track of their payment history.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/payment.gif" alt="payment settings gif">
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Location Search and Filter</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Instead of first choosing from a list of all parking lots and garages compatible
			with JAPA, users can freely search for their destination. This new workflow and
			structure allows for easy scalability and gives more control to users.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/search-filter-gif.gif" alt="search and filter gif">
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			To further narrow the search, users can customize their preferences with the
			filter feature.
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Quick Look to List View</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Quick look serves to show users parking availability without having to click
			into a lot or garage for more information. List view serves to include users
			that may be short on time and want to see all the nearby lots at once.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/quick-look-gif.gif" alt="quick look gif">
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Parking Facility Information</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			The parking facility information page has been broken down into more digestible
			parts, optimized for quick eye scanning. Users can see pricing, hours, parking
			availability, directions, contact information, travel time, and any key information.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/lot-info.gif" alt="parking lot information gif">
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Parking Lot and Garage Layout</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Once users have committed to a parking facility, the ability to check multiple levels
			is available. In the new parking layout, users can easily decide which level to park on
			based on the color coded parking spots. If a level is predominantly red, users can rule
			it out immediately.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/garagefinal-gif.gif" alt="garage layout gif">
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Driver Safety</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Alerts users that they cannot use their phone while driving and all functions will be
			disabled until they've reached a stop. This will ensure that drivers avoid unsafe driving
			unless there is a passenger in the vehicle.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/driver-safety.gif" alt="driver safety gif">
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Saved Lots</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Users can save their frequented lots/garages to check parking availability quickly without
			having to search for the location. They can also delete any locations they no longer visit.

			<div class="callout">
				<div class="padding">
			At this stage, we were able to establish our top solutions for our redesign:
		</div>
	</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		<b>1. Real-time updates</b>
<div class="spacing-8"></div>
		Allowing surplus sharers to assign and change the food availability status on their post and
		notifying seekers of updates would help align expectations between them.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		<b>2. Post customization</b>
<div class="spacing-8"></div>
		Adding more options to allow for post customization would minimize frustration, anxiety,
		and confusion during food acquisition. It would also present more accurate search results.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		<b>3. Non-profit experience optimization</b>
<div class="spacing-8"></div>
		Building out a more comprehensive food map based on resource type would optimize the non-profit
		experience to increase their engagement. Because non-profits are more connected to members of the
		community, their engagement would expand FreeBites' community usage beyond campus.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		<b>4. Social media model</b>
<div class="spacing-8"></div>
		Modeling our design layout and iconography after social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook,
		further asserts that sense of community that FreeBites is aiming for. Adding in a liking feature,
		comments section, and profile acts as encouragement and proof to other users that people in their
		community are also engaging with the app.

<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		1. <i>Too much effort</i><br>

<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		2. <i>Unclear color conventions</i><br>
		Users expressed that the grey colored spots didn't indicate "unavailable" to them but rather "out of order."

		1. <i>Difficult to see entire level</i><br>
		Users expressed that seeing the entire level would be difficult to do while driving because they would have to move the layout around to see it in its entirety.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		2. <i>Unclear level change function</i><br>
		I noticed that users were confused trying to change levels as they tried to swipe on the numbers instead of click on them.

		<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/ab-testing.png" alt="red colored spot and restricted space a/b testing">
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		1. <i>Brighter red</i><br>
		We found that the red parking spot icon on the right was best because users expressed it was more vibrant, bold, and more quickly identified as an occupied space.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		2. <i>Star symbol</i><br>
		We found that users thought the initial R symbol meant reserved not restricted, so we swapped it out for a star because it’s more universally known and indicated some
		kind of special status. In addition, we added an explanation of what the star meant to clarify its meaning even further.

<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		1. <i>Unclear buttons</i><br>
		All users thought that the "Level 1" title was a button and tried to click it. They expressed that it looked like a button because we consistently used this pill shape throughout the rest of the app.
		<br><br>
		2. <i>No zooming in</i><br>
		I noticed that most users didn't try to click on the parking layout cards (photo on the left) because there was nothing to indicate that it was clickable.

		In the final design, I took the users' feedback and turned the "Level 1" title into a button that allowed users to hop in between levels more quickly, not having to swipe through each one.
		I did this to account for garages that may have 10 or more levels and would be too much effort to swipe through.

<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		This was my first time working with other designers as well as the CTO! It was really exciting for me because, I'll be honest, collaborating with people I don't already know
		is a challenge for me. It takes some time for me to get comfortable and be vulnerable sharing ideas and giving critiques. Even though it was challenging at first, it was so
		rewarding for me. I loved seeing our team dynamic evolve as time went on and getting more comfortable with each other. Working closely with JAPA's CTO was also a new and exciting experience!
		I've never had to present my work for non-designers and throughout this process, I learned how to present my designs in a way that was understandable to someone who wasn't directly
		involved in the process and support my design decisions with evidence.

		<div class="right-title">Remote collaboration</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		Just like everyone else, this was my first time collaborating remotely. There's definitely something about physically working around other people that I miss, but this constraint
		offered a unique opportunity to learn how to work efficiently and effectively without the proper resources/materials. I learned how to conduct usability testing and interviews through Zoom (which is
		actually not <i>as</i> terrible as you'd think). I realized how important it is to document everything you're doing and explain concepts clearly to the users you're working with.
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
		<div class="right-title">Advocating for the end-user</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		Like I mentioned, usability testing is the fun part and honestly, it really was. I loved iterating on the feedback users gave and I learned how important it is to always advocate for the end-user.
		It was humbling because I was reminded that my assumptions are definitely not always right and I'm not designing for myself, but for others.
