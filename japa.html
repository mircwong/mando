			01. Project Overview
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			<a target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù href="https://www.parkjapa.com/">JAPA</a> is a free mobile guidance app for consumers that provides access to accurate real-time parking availability, parking lot information, and policies.
			People have places to be and JAPA helps them get there faster. The free app makes it easy to find parking without driving around racing to a space.
			Users can view spots ahead of time to plan out their parking experience. JAPA allows users to park smarter and stress less when they're on the go.
		</div>


		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			Currently, JAPA‚Äôs mobile architecture lacks a well-defined workflow, making it slow and inefficient. Our solution is to design a unique, intuitive mobile
			application for finding parking that will provide a seamless experience that saves time and money.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Current Mobile App
		</div>

		<div class="step-desc">
			These first three screens make up the main menu of JAPA's mobile app. (Left to right) We have the map screen, which is the first screen users see upon opening the app.
			It displays green parking pins signaling where the closest parking lots are relative to the users current location.
			<br>
			<br>
			Next is the "Find Parking" swipe up tab, which displays all the parking lots that are compatible with the JAPA app.
			<br>
			<br>
			Lastly is the slide out menu tab, which allows users to find out more information, report any issues, and clarify any questions.

			02. User Research
		</div>




		<div class="step-title">
			Understanding the client
		</div>

		<div class="step-desc">
		Before getting right down into the user research, we utilized the Business to Human Question technique developed by Sudden Compass¬Æ. This allowed us to discover new and previously
		 unseen opportunities to better understand and meet JAPA's needs. We brainstormed company-centric goals and habits on the left and translated them into customer-centric
		 questions that would help guide our research and keep the users in mind throughout the entire design process.
	</div>

	</div>





	<div class="step-title">
		User Task Analysis
	</div>
	<div class="step-desc">
		To understand the current app's pain points, we conducted a user task analysis to eliminate any biases or assumptions we held prior, lessen the users' mental workload,
		and eliminate any unnecessary steps or screens.
		<br>
		We brainstormed 8 tasks to ask users to accomplish and observed and recorded the actions they took.
	</div>

	<div class="user-task-img">
		<img src="images/JAPA/UserResearch/Tasks.jpg" alt="user-task-results">
	</div>

	<div class="step-title">
		Main Insights
	</div>
	<div class="step-desc">
		From this method, we synthesized our data and determined what was most important to users and what would have made their experience more effortless.
		<div class="two-column">
			<div class="left-side">
				<div class="subtitle">Guide on how to use the app</div>
										There is an absence of instructions on how to navigate through the app. This is especially a pain point for first-time users.

				<div class="subtitle">Search bar to enter in their current location</div>
										The first action users intuitively took was to find a search bar to type in their location.

										<div class="subtitle">Hamburger menu</div>
										Most users barely used the left side hamburger menu.
				</div>

				<div class="right-side">
					<div class="subtitle">Visual aids</div>
										Many users wanted visual aids, like a legend or key to help guide them throughout the app. The color coded parking dots were confusing to them.
					<div class="subtitle">Parking markers</div>
														Parking markers were utilized over the "Find Parking" swipe up tab.
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>






		<div class="step-title">
			Competitive Analysis
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
		We used a competitive analysis matrix to determine JAPA's current strengths and weaknesses in comparison to competitors in the market. Through this evaluation,
		we were able to establish what made JAPA unique as well as identify what features and	strategies were working for their competition. We were also able to get
		 a better understanding of the market landscape and determine where JAPA stands in it.

		<div class="step-title">
			Main Insights
		</div>

		<div class="step-desc">
			<div class="two-column">
				<div class="left-side">
					<div class="subtitle">Essential Features</div>
											JAPA's current app lacks many essential features that make for a seamless parking experience as well as competing apps
											successful (i.e. Searchbar + filtering, in-app ability to reserve parking, parking time limits, driver safety, etc.)
					</div>

					<div class="right-side">
						<div class="subtitle">Driver Safety</div>
											None of the competing apps considered a "driver safety" precaution. We wanted to include this in our final solution
											because we did not want to promote unsafe driving (using the app while driving) and wanted to have something that distinguished
											JAPA from other apps.
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>






			<div class="step-title">
				User Personas
			</div>
				<div class="step-desc">
					From the user task and competitive analysis, we created these two personas to represent the different user types that might use JAPA.

				<div class="step-title">
				The Golden Path
			</div>
			<div class="step-desc">
							We took some time together to come up with a "Golden Path" that a user would most likely take as they use the app. This path is the ideal
							path a user should take, highlighting the the key steps that help the users find our app's real value. By knowing our product's ideal path,
							we can focus our work and prioritize the central flow of the app.

					<div class="step-title">
					How Might We's + Affinity Mapping
				</div>
				<div class="step-desc">
							We brainstormed How Might We questions individually to frame our ideation and explore potential features and designs. We reconvened to sort through similar
							and frequent ideas and organize them into an affinity map. This helped us gather large amounts of data collected and organize them into categories  or themes
						 	based on their relationships.
				</div>

				<div class="how-might-we">
						<img src="images/JAPA/Ideation/hmw.jpg" alt="hmw2">
				</div>

				<div class="affinity-map">
						<img src="images/JAPA/Ideation/affinity-mapping.jpg" alt="affinity-map">
				</div>

				<div class="step-desc">
					Underneath the hairline break in each category, we noted down ideas for potential features that could account for the How Might We's. Then we voted for an
					idea/feature we thought was the most important (each colored dot indicates what we individually voted for). Below is an explanation of the features we came up
					with and agreed on and why they're essential to our design.

							<div class="subtitle">Feature 01: Embedded Map</div>
							We wanted to keep users from switching between outside navigation apps and embedding a map into the app would help eliminate this.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>What will this look like?</b> Users will be able to see a highlighted route within the app from their current location to the destination where they would like
							to park. They can still redirect to an outside navigation app, such as Google Maps or Waze if they would like to.

							<div class="subtitle">Feature 02: Directly Labeled Parking Spot</div>
							During user research we found that our users didn't know what each colored parking dot meant and wished there was some kind of legend to guide them. However, a legend would
							be add unnecessary screens to our design. Thus, we decided that directly labeled parking spot icons would be more intuitive.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>What will this look like?</b> Because parking lots and garages have special or restricted spots, such as Handicap or staff/student parking to name a few, we would use
							different symbols in each dot to quickly indicate these restrictions to users.

							<div class="subtitle">Feature 03: Map Quick Look + List View</div>
							Because many users valued efficiency and speed, checking each lot or garage for parking availability would waste time. This presents an opportunity for a feature that allows users
							to preview what parking is like without having to click unnecessary screens.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>What will this look like?</b> To ensure that users could quickly skim through parking lots/garages within close proximity of their destination, they can swipe through lot info cards on the map
							screen. In addition, users can switch to list view to see all the lots that fit their needs on one page with all the necessary information presented to them.

							<div class="subtitle">Feature 04: Filtering</div>
							With scalability in mind, we thought with a lot of parking lots and garages, it would be difficult for users to narrow down their search.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>What will this look like?</b> Filters would also help narrow down their search and help users find parking spots that fit their specific needs. For example,
							users could find lots or garages that have security on site or electric vehicle charging stations.

							<div class="subtitle">Feature 05: Favorite Lots</div>
							Most of our audience consists of college students or working young adults. Because these types of users often frequent places, it would be a waste of time to have to
							search for their destination and check parking availability each time.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>What will this look like?</b> There will be a page housed in the fixed navigation for favorited lots and garages so that users can easily locate them and check to
							see if there are any spots available before starting their commute.

							<div class="subtitle">Feature 06: Driver Safety</div>
							From our competitive analysis, we find out that no other competitors considered a "driver safety" precaution. Although this was a little outside the scope of our project,
							we thought it would be important to include in our design because we wanted to ensure that JAPA wouldn't be promoting unsafe driving, especially on university campuses or workplaces.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>What will this look like?</b> If users try to use their phones while driving, a warning will pop up and all app functions will be disabled until they've reached a stop.

							<div class="subtitle">Feature 07: Onboarding</div>
							First-time users of the app were unsure how to navigate through and wanted a guide to help them accomplish their goals more quickly. The current app brings users straight into the
							map screen without an explanation for how to use the app.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>What will this look like?</b> Upon opening the app, users will be presented with a "how to use" onboarding tutorial that will be broken down into steps. Users can also choose to skip
							the tutorial if they wish.

			<div class="step-desc">
