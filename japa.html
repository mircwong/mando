			01. Project Overview
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			<a target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù href="https://www.parkjapa.com/">JAPA</a> is a free mobile guidance app for consumers that provides access to accurate real-time parking availability, parking lot information, and policies.
			People have places to be and JAPA helps them get there faster. The free app makes it easy to find parking without driving around racing to a space.
			Users can view spots ahead of time to plan out their parking experience. JAPA allows users to park smarter and stress less when they're on the go.
		</div>


		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			Currently, JAPA‚Äôs mobile architecture lacks a well-defined workflow, making it slow and inefficient. Our solution is to design a unique, intuitive mobile
			application for finding parking that will provide a seamless experience that saves time and money.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Current Mobile App
		</div>

		<div class="step-desc">
			These first three screens make up the main menu of JAPA's mobile app. (Left to right) We have the map screen, which is the first screen users see upon opening the app.
			It displays green parking pins signaling where the closest parking lots are relative to the users current location.
			<br>
			<br>
			Next is the "Find Parking" swipe up tab, which displays all the parking lots that are compatible with the JAPA app.
			<br>
			<br>
			Lastly is the slide out menu tab, which allows users to find out more information, report any issues, and clarify any questions.

			02. User Research
		</div>




		<div class="step-title">
			Understanding the client
		</div>

		<div class="step-desc">
		Before getting right down into the user research, we utilized the Business to Human Question technique developed by Sudden Compass¬Æ. This allowed us to discover new and previously
		 unseen opportunities to better understand and meet JAPA's needs. We brainstormed company-centric goals and habits on the left and translated them into customer-centric
		 questions that would help guide our research and keep the users in mind throughout the entire design process.
	</div>

	</div>





	<div class="step-title">
		User Task Analysis
	</div>
	<div class="step-desc">
		To understand the current app's pain points, we conducted a user task analysis to eliminate any biases or assumptions we held prior, lessen the users' mental workload,
		and eliminate any unnecessary steps or screens.
		<br>
		We brainstormed 8 tasks to ask users to accomplish and observed and recorded the actions they took.
	</div>

	</div>

	<div class="step-title">
		Main Insights
	</div>
	<div class="step-desc">
		From this method, we synthesized our data and determined what was most important to users and what would have made their experience more effortless.
		<div class="two-column">
			<div class="left-side">
				<div class="subtitle">Guide on how to use the app</div>
										There is an absence of instructions on how to navigate through the app. This is especially a pain point for first-time users.

				<div class="subtitle">Search bar to enter in their current location</div>
										The first action users intuitively took was to find a search bar to type in their location.

										<div class="subtitle">Hamburger menu</div>
										Most users barely used the left side hamburger menu.
				</div>

				<div class="right-side">
					<div class="subtitle">Visual aids</div>
										Many users wanted visual aids, like a legend or key to help guide them throughout the app. The color coded parking dots were confusing to them.
					<div class="subtitle">Parking markers</div>
														Parking markers were utilized over the "Find Parking" swipe up tab.
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>






		<div class="step-title">
			Competitive Analysis
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
		We used a competitive analysis matrix to determine JAPA's current strengths and weaknesses in comparison to competitors in the market. Through this evaluation,
		we were able to establish what made JAPA unique as well as identify what features and	strategies were working for their competition. We were also able to get
		 a better understanding of the market landscape and determine where JAPA stands in it.

		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Main Insights
		</div>

		<div class="step-desc">
			<div class="two-column">
				<div class="left-side">
					<div class="subtitle">Essential Features</div>
											JAPA's current app lacks many essential features that make for a seamless parking experience as well as competing apps
											successful (i.e. Searchbar + filtering, in-app ability to reserve parking, parking time limits, driver safety, etc.)
					</div>

					<div class="right-side">
						<div class="subtitle">Driver Safety</div>
											None of the competing apps considered a "driver safety" precaution. We wanted to include this in our final solution
											because we did not want to promote unsafe driving (using the app while driving) and wanted to have something that distinguished
											JAPA from other apps.
						</div>
					</div>

				User Personas
