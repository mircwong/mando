			During the first week's UX research sprint, we decided that we needed

			evaluating competing platforms.

			a lack of direction — a user does not know what to do in the app — and
			a lack of meaningful visual design.

<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			To improve upon these areas, we turned the “Level 1” title into a button that allowed

			more closely.

		We changed the red parking spot icon color to a more vibrant and bold red, which more

<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			After opening the app, new users are prompted to create an account
			by entering their phone number, name, vehicle information, and preferred payment method.
			This serves to make all future parking experiences simpler, such as
			paying for parking and identifying where they last parked.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/sign-in-gif.gif" alt="sign in gif">
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Once finished or skipped, users can choose to learn how to use the app
			in 6 simple onboarding steps.

<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Payment Settings</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Entering their payment information allows for future integration
			of an in-app parking ticket payment system. Users can easily make
			purchases and keep track of their payment history.

<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Location Search and Filter</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Instead of first choosing from a list of all parking lots and garages compatible
			with JAPA, users can freely search for their destination. This new workflow and
			structure allows for easy scalability and gives more control to users.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/search-filter-gif.gif" alt="search and filter gif">
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			To further narrow the search, users can customize their preferences with the
			filter feature.
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Quick Look to List View</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Quick look serves to show users parking availability without having to click
			into a lot or garage for more information. List view serves to include users
			that may be short on time and want to see all the nearby lots at once.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			<img src="images/JAPA/Prototyping/quick-look-gif.gif" alt="quick look gif">
<div class="spacing-32"></div>
			<div class="right-title">Parking Facility Information</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			The parking facility information page has been broken down into more digestible
			parts, optimized for quick eye scanning. Users can see pricing, hours, parking
			availability, directions, contact information, travel time, and any key information.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>

			<div class="right-title">Parking Lot and Garage Layout</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Once users have committed to a parking facility, the ability to check multiple levels
			is available. In the new parking layout, users can easily decide which level to park on
			based on the color coded parking spots. If a level is predominantly red, users can rule
			it out immediately.

			<div class="right-title">Driver Safety</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Alerts users that they cannot use their phone while driving and all functions will be
			disabled until they've reached a stop. This will ensure that drivers avoid unsafe driving
			unless there is a passenger in the vehicle.

		This was my first time working with other designers as well as the CTO! It was really exciting for me because, I'll be honest, collaborating with people I don't already know
		is a challenge for me. It takes some time for me to get comfortable and be vulnerable sharing ideas and giving critiques. Even though it was challenging at first, it was so
		rewarding for me. I loved seeing our team dynamic evolve as time went on and getting more comfortable with each other. Working closely with JAPA's CTO was also a new and exciting experience!
		I've never had to present my work for non-designers and throughout this process, I learned how to present my designs in a way that was understandable to someone who wasn't directly

		actually not <i>as</i> terrible as you'd think). I realized how important it is to document everything you're doing and explain concepts clearly to the users you're working with.

		It was humbling because I was reminded that my assumptions are definitely not always right and I'm not designing for myself, but for others.
