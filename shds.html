			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			UC Davis Student Housing provides a home to over 10,000 UC Davis undergraduate and graduate students. About 6,000 students reside in the
			residence halls, most of them in their first year at the university. Student Housing's mission is to provide living, dining and academic support
			services that facilitate a successful transition to the UC Davis community and foster ongoing learning and life-skill development.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b><span style = "color:#00B5E2;">UC Davis Orientation is held to help first-year and transfer students prepare for a great first year.
				The experience is split into three parts: Aggie 101, Aggie Advising, and Aggie Orientation</span></b>.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			UC Davis Orientation hires over 600 student leaders in four different positions who make Aggie Orientation possible. This year's orientation experience implemented a new three-part system
		where each part had a corresponding color to differentiate itself from the others. <b><span style = "color:#00B5E2;">My role was to
		design the new hire marketing materials and branding for the upcoming 2020 orientation that incorporated this new standard</span></b>.
		<div class="three-column">
			<div class="left-side">
						<div class="subtitle"><span style = "color:#62BB46;">Aggie 101</span></div>
						Learn about UC Davis resources, explore your Aggie community, and prepare to arrive on campus - all online.
				</div>

					<div class="middle">
						<div class="subtitle"><span style = "color:#F7921E;">Aggie Advising</span></div>
						Receive academic advising remotely in preparation for course schedule planning and registration.
					</div>
					<div class="right-side">
								<div class="subtitle"><span style = "color:#00B5E2;">Aggie Orientation</span></div>
								Get excited about being an Aggie! Build community networks of support, find resources, and begin your life on campus during our five day program.

			Email Header
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			These are two email headers that I designed and sent for review. I was given a lot of freedom with these designs, however, the only constraint was to utilize
			the three colors for each part of orientation. We ultimately decided to move forward with the second design.

				<div class="step-desc">
					UC Davis Student Housing utilizes their social media handles (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, etc.) to advertise for events and promotions. I designed these
					Facebook frames for orientation leaders to post to reach a broader student audience.
