			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			UC Davis Student Housing provides a home to over 10,000 UC Davis undergraduate and graduate students. About 6,000 students reside in the
			residence halls, most of them in their first year at the university. Student Housing's mission is to provide living, dining and academic support
			services that facilitate a successful transition to the UC Davis community and foster ongoing learning and life-skill development.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b><span style = "color:#00B5E2;">UC Davis Orientation is held to help first-year and transfer students prepare for a great first year.
				The experience is split into three parts: Aggie 101, Aggie Advising, and Aggie Orientation</span></b>.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			UC Davis Orientation hires over 600 student leaders in four different positions who make Aggie Orientation possible. This year's orientation experience implemented a new three-part system
		where each part had a corresponding color to differentiate itself from the others. <b><span style = "color:#00B5E2;">My role was to
		design the new hire marketing materials and branding for the upcoming 2020 orientation that incorporated this new standard</span></b>.
		<div class="three-column">
			<div class="left-side">
						<div class="subtitle"><span style = "color:#62BB46;">Aggie 101</span></div>
						Learn about UC Davis resources, explore your Aggie community, and prepare to arrive on campus - all online.
				</div>

					<div class="middle">
						<div class="subtitle"><span style = "color:#F7921E;">Aggie Advising</span></div>
						Receive academic advising remotely in preparation for course schedule planning and registration.
					</div>
					<div class="right-side">
								<div class="subtitle"><span style = "color:#00B5E2;">Aggie Orientation</span></div>
								Get excited about being an Aggie! Build community networks of support, find resources, and begin your life on campus during our five day program.

			02. Design

		<div class="step-title">
			Email Header
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			These are two email headers that I designed and sent for review. I was given a lot of freedom with these designs, however, the only constraint was to utilize
			the three colors for each part of orientation. We ultimately decided to move forward with the second design.

					Social Media
				</div>
				<div class="step-desc">
					UC Davis Student Housing utilizes their social media handles (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, etc.) to advertise for events and promotions. I designed these
					Facebook frames for orientation leaders to post to reach a broader student audience.

						<div class="step-title">
							Lanyards
						</div>
						<div class="step-desc">
							I designed these lanyards to be handed out to all orientation leaders during the event. It was also a possibility for these lanyards (without the tag)
							to be given out to new students if the budget allowed.

						05. Reflection
					</div>
					<div class="step-title">
						Lessons & Takeaways
					</div>
					<div class="step-desc">
						Disclaimer: Some of these designs were used in marketing for new hire materials, however, some were what I would have hoped to see if I had more leverage in
						making executive decisions for the event. Despite not being able to see all of these designs come to surface, I really enjoyed creating this vision for the brand identity.
						Because I work at UC Davis Student Housing as a student assistant, my work must be approved by many important campus professionals and trying to maintain the UC Davis
						branding without sacrificing my creativity and design style has posed a challenge for me. However, I've been able to design for much larger audiences and explore
						ways of creating a happy medium between maintaining the university's image as well as my own style. It's still in progress, but doing this kind of work, I've learned to design more unselfishly
						and think about how others will perceive and experience my work rather than just myself.
