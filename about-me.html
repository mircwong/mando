				I'm a rising senior double majoring in Design and Business Economics at UC Davis, where I'm currently VP Education and a UX
				Design Consultant at Design Interactive, UC Davis‚Äô first student-run human-centered design consultancy, where we work to solve
				 pressing challenges for businesses and nonprofits.

			Now, let's get into how I found my way into human-centered design..

				When I was younger, I wanted to be an animator. At Disneyland, the Animation Academy was my favorite attraction
				(seriously, it wasn‚Äôt a real trip unless we participated in at least 5 sessions).  I remember once I got
				home, I'd take those sketches and transfer them into sticky-note flip books to write new adventures for the characters.
				This love guided me in choosing design as my major because UC Davis offered 3D object and motion design classes.

			<div class="more-about-desc">
									<div class="about-emoji">‚úíÔ∏è</div>
				Although it wasn't the path I chose, it got me curious about how design had the power to influence, teach, and inspire people.
				This curiousity led me to pursue a new path. During my freshman year, I traded in my flip books for ctrl+z and the pen tool.
				I found myself sucked into graphic design. I thought I had found "my thing," but I was still looking for something more.

			It wasn't until I was trying to figure out where an unusual charge on my credit card came from that UX made itself known in my life. I was
			struggling to navigate through the Wells Fargo app and found myself thinking about how it could be improved.
			From then on, I read up on everything UX and started my first project: redesigning the Wells Fargo app. From collecting data to
			prototyping the micro-interactions of a swipe function, I loved the storytelling aspect of it all because it engaged users not as consumers, executives, or investors, but as humans.

			<div class="more-about-desc">
									<div class="about-emoji">üíó</div>
			 Fast forward to today, I'm passionate about harnessing people's stories to advocate for accessibility and push for social good.
			 Stories are what stick with people and I'm excited to build products that shape their lives and narratives.
