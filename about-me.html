				Design Consultant at Design Interactive, UC Davis‚Äô first student-run human-centered design consultancy, where we work to solve
				 pressing challenges for businesses and nonprofits.

			Now, let's get into how I found my way into human-centered design..

				When I was younger, I wanted to be an animator. At Disneyland, the Animation Academy was my favorite attraction
				(seriously, it wasn‚Äôt a fulfilling trip unless we participated in at least 5 sessions). I'd take those sketches home and
			 	create storyboards and sticky-note flip books to write new adventures for these characters.
				This guided me in choosing design as my major because it offered me 3D object and motion design classes at UC Davis.

			</div>


			<div class="more-about-desc">
				Although it wasn't the path I chose, it got me curious about how design played a supporting role in commanding and captivating an audience.
				During my freshman year, I traded in my flip books for ctrl+z and the pen tool.
				I found myself sucked into graphic design. I thought I had found "my thing," but the initial excitement faded over time.

			<div class="more-about-desc">
			It wasn't I was trying to figure out where an unusual charge on my credit card came from. I was
			struggling to navigate through the Wells Fargo app and found myself thinking about how it could be improved.
			From then on, I read up on everything UX and started my first project: redesigning the Wells Fargo app. From collecting data to
			prototyping the micro-interactions of a swipe function, I love understanding users' narratives and harnessing real-world data to create
			beautiful, extremely versatile and ubiquitous solutions.

			</div>

			<div class="more-about-desc">
			 Fast forward to today, I'm passionate about employing my design thinking skills to bring people's stories to life, advocate for accessibility,
			 and push for social good. I love the storytelling aspect of UX design because it has a clean structure and concrete goals of that structure.
			 It helps me see the bigger picture and fuses creativity together with analytical thinking and real data.
