				<div class="storyline-title">The Story</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
					My team and I were challenged to build off of the current JAPA app and create an improved, new design.
					<br><br>
					<b>The main objectives:</b> <br><br> 1) Redesign the entire app to provide users with a smooth and pleasant experience <br> 2) Design for scalability and future feature integrations
					<br><br>
					<b>My Role:</b> <br><br> I designed and prototyped the parking layout and driver safety aspect of our product as well as conducted usability and A/B testing to validate the final forms.
					My team and I all contributed to research, idea generation, and the final presentation. We all worked frequently and closely with JAPA's CTO to get feedback and build our solutions.

				<div class="main-step-title">What is the current parking experience like and why is it a problem?</div>
						<div class="step-description">
							Before the COVID-19 spread, people had places to be and time was of the essence. Just when they thought they had enough problems,
							looking for parking took its place on the neverending list. Simply put, parking is challenging. Lots and garages are often very crowded,
							regulations and pricing can’t be determined until arrival, and the time spent looking for parking is unpredictable. Because of these reasons,
							drivers are forced to leave their house earlier to account for time spent searching for a space and bounce between parking facilities that are full.
							Drivers are left frustrated and now they’re late for their commitments.

				<div class="problem-description">
					While JAPA fills the need for a real-time guidance platform that provides users with parking options and reliable,
					live information and updates, the app is more focused on simple functionality than catering toward a variety of needs and fostering an
					emotional or personal connection with users.

				<div class="storyline-title">The Solution</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
				We designed a set of new features within the JAPA app that supports a much wider range of needs. The new design takes new and returning users on a more controlled,
				personalized journey and uses unique features such as the map quick look to list view, filtering, and garage level card swipe to guide drivers smoothly to their destination.
				By integrating these features and mimicking the in-app journey to the external parking experience, JAPA creates a more full, guided experience for users and builds a more
				lasting relationship with them.

								<div class="process-description">
									<b>A/B Testing Takeaways</b><br><br>
									1. <i>Brighter red</i><br>
									We found that the red parking spot icon on the right was best because users expressed it was more vibrant, bold, and more quickly identified as an occupied space.
									<br><br>
									2. <i>Star symbol</i><br>
									We found that users thought the initial R symbol meant reserved not restricted, so we swapped it out for a star because it’s more universally known and indicated some

									<b>Improvements</b><br><br>
									In the final design, I took the users' feedback and turned the "Level 1" title into a button that allowed users to hop in between levels more quickly, not having to swipe through each one.
									I did this to account for garages that may have 10 or more levels and would be too much effort to swipe through.

									In addition, I added a magnifying glass in the bottom right corner of each card to indicate that they could zoom in to see the level more closely.

						<div class="reflection-title">Remote collaboration</div>
												<div class="reflection-description">
												Just like everyone else, this was my first time collaborating remotely. There's definitely something about physically working around other people that I miss, but this constraint
												offered a unique opportunity to learn how to work efficiently and effectively without the proper resources/materials. I learned how to conduct usability testing and interviews through Zoom (which is
												actually not <i>as</i> terrible as you'd think). I realized how important it is to document everything you're doing and explain concepts clearly to the users you're working with.

						<div class="reflection-title">Advocating for the end-user</div>
												<div class="reflection-description">
												Like I mentioned, usability testing is the fun part and honestly, it really was. I loved iterating on the feedback users gave and I learned how important it is to always advocate for the end-user.
												It was humbling because I was reminded that my assumptions are definitely not always right and I'm not designing for myself, but for others.
