			01. Project Overview
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			The American premium television network,<b><span style = "color:#0EB2F0;"> HBO</span></b> offers a variety
			 of television series, documentaries, sports, movies, and more. HBO Go is an extension of their network,
			 allowing customers with a paid subscription to stream HBO content on demand from anywhere.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Current Web Design
		</div>
		<div class="three-triangle">
			<div class="three-left-img">
			     <img src="images/HBOGo/hbo-nav.png" alt="hbogo-nav">

		</div>


		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			The current web design feels impersonal and overly simple, creating a
			mediocre and uninspiring experience for customers. It is also lacking in essential features,
			such as content description or a play next episode button, thus making it frustrating for customers
			to indulge in any content on the platform with ease. <b><span style = "color:#0EB2F0;">The purpose of this project
				is to redesign the web interface and add and move features to make it easier and more engaging to watch content on HBO Go</span></b>.

		<div class="process-step">
			02. User Research
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			User Interviews
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			Because HBO has a diverse audience, I decided to conduct interviews with people in and out of my immediate network,
			but also use the HBO Go reviews customers have left to guide my redesign.
			<br>
			<br>
			To gain meaningful insight on the needs and priorities of my audience, I asked a series of questions while users
 			interacted with the current website.


			<div class="question-title">
				How do you decide what to watch when you‚Äôre browsing?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				What, if anything, caused you frustration using this platform?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				Is HBO your first choice to consume media content? If not, what makes you gravitate
				toward your preferred platform?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				How might you improve its design and usability?
			</div>

			<div class="step-title">
				Competitive Analysis
			</div>
			<div class="step-desc">
				Because all those I interviewed referenced HBO competitors, I decided to analyze what they were doing to engage users that HBO Go might lack.
				I focused on two leading competitors, Hulu and Netflix. These series of comparisons will guide me in determining where HBO Go falls short, how they
				can rise up to market standards, and what they can do to differentiate itself from its competitors.

				Primary Concerns
			</div>
				<div class="step-desc">
						After collecting these interview responses and examining competing platforms, I was able to reduce these insights down into three primary concerns that my redesign
						of HBO Go will tackle.
				</div>
							<div class="two-column">
								<div class="left-side">
									<div class="subtitle">Lack of individualized content</div>
															There is an absence of personalized content curation (i.e. recommendations), thus creating a sense of distance
															<br>
															<br>
															Feels like a one-time use platform
									<div class="subtitle">The interface is uninviting and unmemorable</div>
															The layout of content is exactly the same throughout the entire page, which feels unexciting
															and causes viewers to quickly scroll through without wanting to explore
	                </div>

									<div class="right-side">
										<div class="subtitle">Little to no assistance in guiding and informing users</div>
															Users are forced to hunt for their desired content because of the lack of content descriptions,
															play next buttons, and other essential features that make for an easy watching experience
															<br>
															<br>
															There's a lack of previews/trailers that would interest the users

		<div class="step-title">
			Wireframes
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			I took the initial sketches and translated them into simple wireframes. I was able to
			explore different layouts that best displayed the information to the user and ease their
			watching experience. I added many features that I deemed suitable in aiding the viewer and minimizing
			the frustration that many users expressed in their interviews and reviews.

					<div class="step-title">
						High-Fidelty Prototype
					</div>
					<div class="step-desc">
						For the final prototype design, I wanted to ensure that I continued the night time/dark theme that HBO Go applies across all platforms
						to maintain their brand identity despite updating the overall interface. Like mentioned throughout my process, I hoped to build this redesign
						around the users and integrate systems and features that would ease their watching experience. Ultimately, I wanted the user
						to feel like a more valued customer and excited to explore all the content that HBO Go has to offer.

						<div class="step-desc">
							The design I decided on for the video playback screen incorporated features that users expressed would make the viewing experience much easier. Similar to
							Netflix's "skip intro" button that pops up before every media content, I wanted users to have that option. The break in the playback bar indicates where
							the actual episode begins and users can jump straight to that point if they choose. I hoped that this would eliminate the frustration of fast-forwarding
							and guessing where the intro ends the episode starts. In addition, I made sure to add a "play next episode" feature that pops up when the viewer is nearing
							an appropriate time at the end of an episode to ensure that the viewing experience is not disrupted by excessive clicking around to search for the desired content.

						05. Reflection
					</div>
					<div class="step-title">
						Lessons & Takeaways
					</div>
					<div class="step-desc">
					What was most significant about this project was that I was able to analyze existing systems and explore ways of improving them. Especially conducting
					the competitive analysis study, I was able to really understand why HBO Go's competitors' were so successful and users were engaged with their products.
					A lot of excitement I experience with being a designer comes from designing for others in mind and this project has fueled that interest, while also
					teaching me about how to design for understanding as the end goal.
					<br>
					<br>
					In the future, if I were to have time to come back to this project, I would like to produce a few more iterations and test the level of usability across a
					more broad audience. I would also like to redesign the mobile app as well to create a stronger connection between HBO Go's web and mobile platforms. I would Like
					to be able to think more deeply about their on-demand access to content and how to best implement that for different mediums, whether that be mobile, web, television, etc.
