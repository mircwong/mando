			01. Project Overview
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			The American premium television network,<b><span style = "color:#0EB2F0;"> HBO</span></b> offers a variety
			 of television series, documentaries, sports, movies, and more. HBO Go is an extension of their network,
			 allowing customers with a paid subscription to stream HBO content on demand from anywhere.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			The current web and mobile designs feel impersonal and are overly simple, creating a
			mediocre and uninspiring experience for customers. It is also lacking in essential features,
			such as a resume series playback or watch next button, thus making it frustrating for customers
			to indulge in any content on the platform. <b><span style = "color:#0EB2F0;">The purpose of this project
				is to redesign the web interface to make it easier and more engaging to watch content on HBO Go</span></b>.
		</div>

		<div class="process-step">
			02. User Research
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			User Interviews
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			Because HBO has a diverse audience, I decided to conduct interviews with people in my immediate network,
			but also use the HBO Go reviews customers have left to guide my redesign.
			<br>
			<br>
			To gain meaningful insight on the needs and priorities of my audience, I asked a series of questions while users
 			interacted with the current website.


			<div class="question-title">
				How do you decide what to watch when you‚Äôre browsing?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				What, if anything, caused you frustration using this platform?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				Is HBO your first choice to consume media content? If not, what makes you gravitate
				toward your preferred platform?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				How might you improve its design and usability?
			</div>

			<div class="interview-img">
				<img src="images/HBOGo/hbogo-interview-results.png" alt="hbogo-interviews">
			</div>
			After collecting these interview responses, I was able to reduce these insights down into three primary concerns.
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Primary Concerns
		</div>
						<div class="two-column">
							<div class="left-side">
								<div class="subtitle">‚óã‚Ää Lack of individualized content</div>
														There is an absence of personalized content curation (i.e. recommendations), thus creating a sense of distance
														<br>
														<br>
														Feels like a one-time use platform
								<div class="subtitle">‚óã‚Ää The interface is uninviting and unmemorable</div>
														The layout of content is exactly the same throughout the entire page, which feels unexciting
														and causes viewers to quickly scroll through without wanting to explore
                </div>

								<div class="right-side">
									<div class="subtitle">‚óã‚ÄäLittle to no assistance in guiding and informing users</div>
														Users are forced to hunt for their desired content because of the lack of content descriptions,
														play next buttons, and other essential features that make for an easy watching experience
														<br>
														<br>
														There's a lack of previews/trailers that would interest the users
	                </div>
							</div>

			<div class="step-title">
				Competitive Analysis
			</div>
			<div class="step-desc">
				Because all those I interviewed referenced HBO competitors, I decided to analyze what they were doing to engage users that HBO Go might lack.
				I focused on two leading competitors, Hulu and Netflix. These series of comparisons will guide me in determining where HGO Go falls short, how they
				can rise up to market standards, and what they can do to differentiate itself from its competitors.

			Wireframes
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			I took the key features and translated them into simple wireframes. I was mainly focused on
			exploring different layouts that centralized the most interaction-heavy items, best
			displayed the information to the user, and unified nagivation elements.

			Iterating & User Testing
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			In order to assess the new design‚Äôs friendliness and usability, I had 4 people from ages 20 to 55
			 test out these wireframes. I gave each individual the same set of tasks to accomplish and had each of
			  them walk through their user flow.
		</div>

		<div class="two-column">

				<div class="subtitle">‚óã‚Ää 4 users</div>

						<b><span style = "color:#0EB2F0;">4</span>/4</b> users were able to navigate to the Transfer & Pay screen and begin the transfer

						<b><span style = "color:#0EB2F0;">4</span>/4</b> users were able to check their notifications and noted that the yellow ‚Äúalert‚Äù

						<div class="two-column">
							<div class="left-side">
								<div class="subtitle">‚óã‚Ää Small text size</div>
														When older users were examining the screen layouts, they noted that it was difficult to see the text clearly, especially
														in areas with multiple lines of text
														<br>
														<br>
														They also expressed that some subtext, for example, "Available Balance," was easily overlooked given its light font weight and size
								</div>
								<div class="right-side">
									<div class="subtitle">‚óã‚Ää Small icon size</div>
														Similar to the small text size, 3/4 users noted that the icon sizes might be too small and could be increased for better visibility
									<div class="subtitle">‚óã‚Ää Need for a "help" button</div>
														2/4 users expressed that it might be helpful to have a "help" button somewhere convenient, especially for long-time users who
														are used to the old design and are trying to get acclamated to the updated version
								</div>
							</div>
					</div>

					<div class="step-title">
						High-Fidelty Prototype
					</div>
					<div class="step-desc">
						After discussing with the same people I interviewed and receiving feedback, I was able to create more structured and effective layouts of the simple wireframes.
						I also concentrated on implementing the Wells Fargo color palette in a purposeful and consistent way that aligned with the new brand identity.
					</div>
					<div class="proto-img">
						<img src="images/HBOGo/hbogo-screen1.png" alt="hbogo-screen1">
						<div class="step-desc">
							One of the most important features I wanted to include in this redesign was the static navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. It houses
							all of the most interaction-heavy features so that it can be found quickly and conveniently. As for the left slide out menu, it combines the information found in
							the original double slide out menus. I wanted to ensure that information is grouped effectively in this redesign so that like items can be found in a single place.
							<br>
							<br>
							The redesign of the Checking and Credit Card accounts focus on displaying the most essential information to ease to the user
							into the page and avoid overwhelming them.

					<div class="process-step">
						05. Reflection
					</div>
					<div class="step-title">
						Lessons & Takeaways
					</div>
					<div class="step-desc">
						Throughout the course of this project, I most enjoyed user interviews and implementing better systems that addressed their concerns.
						I learned that I actually like a bit of complexity as it allows me to search for connections and relationships within systems
						and out in the real world. This helped develop my own understanding of people and how to meet their needs that they didn't even
						know they had.
						<br>
						<br>
						In the future, I would like to try to conduct user research that extends beyond my immediate network to gain more insight on users' concerns.
						I would also like to have iterated a bit more and done more user testing to validate this redesign. The next steps for this project would
						be to design further into the other navigation features like Deposit and Send to get a more holistic view of the functions of this app.
