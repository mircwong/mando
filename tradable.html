							Tradable is a mobile application that provides college students with a quick, convenient, and easy way to buy and sell used or new textbooks and supplies. It helps alleviate some of the stress that comes with

					<a target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù  href = "https://davisdi.org">Design Interactive</a> is UC Davis‚Äô first student-run human-centered design consultancy operating at the intersection of psychology, technology, and problem-solving. We use our diverse skills in social sciences research, prototyping, and visual design to help solve pressing challenges for businesses and nonprofits.
						<br><br>
						<b>The design challenge:</b> <br><br> Prospective applicants were tasked to identify a particular problem or a pain point that college students may have during their transition into college and design a solution on how we would improve this experience.
						<br><br>
						<b>My Role:</b> <br><br> I researched the problem space and spoke to stakeholders through direct interviews and designed and prototyped the final product concept.

							<div class="step-description">
							Students often encounter many challenges transitioning into college. One of the most common challenges is dealing with financial burdens. With tuition and living costs, students refrain
							from buying non-essential items, however, it is common for professors to require extremely expensive textbooks and supplies for their classes. And accordingly, students turn to online textbook/supply
							marketplaces. Although this is a great place for students to buy and sell at affordable prices, it is hassle and frustrating to find what they‚Äôre looking for conveniently and quickly, sometimes leaving
							them with only one option: to buy new and expensive materials from the campus store.

						I designed a new system for new and returning students that resolves the issues that come with the physical and online experience of buying and selling academic materials. I included the necessary
