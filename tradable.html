			01. Project Overview
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Background
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			<a target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù href="http://davisdi.org/"><b><span style = "color:#4949E7;">Design Interactive</span></b></a> is UC Davis‚Äô first student-run human-centered design consultancy operating at the
			intersection of psychology, technology, and problem-solving. We use our diverse skills in social sciences research, prototyping,
			 and visual design to help solve pressing challenges for businesses and nonprofits.
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 For this design challenge, prospective applicants were tasked to identify a particular problem or
 			a pain point that college students may have during their transition into college and design a solution on how we would improve this experience.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Objective
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			Students often encounter many challenges transitioning into college. One of the most common challenges is dealing with financial burdens.
			With tuition and living costs, students refrain from buying non-essential items, however, it is common for professors to require extremely
			expensive textbooks and supplies for their classes. And accordingly, students turn to online textbook/supply marketplaces. Although this is
			a great place for students to buy and sell at affordable prices, it is hassle and frustrating to find what they‚Äôre looking for conveniently
			and quickly, sometimes leaving them with only one option: to buy new and expensive materials from the campus store.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b><span style = "color:#4949E7;">Tradable is a mobile application that provides college students with a quick, convenient, and easy way to buy and
				sell used or new textbooks and supplies.</span></b> It helps alleviate some of the stress that comes with purchasing one-time use course materials.
				It also provides a space for students to find what they need all in one organized place.
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Design Challenge Constraints
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			No more than 5 mockup screens
			<br>
			Use Figma (not required, but highly preferred)
			<br>
			Complete within 4-6 hours

			02. User Research
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			User Interviews
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			My first approach was to interview three college students to understand their needs and pain points in buying and selling school
			supplies. My main interest was finding out:

			<div class="question-title">
				What frustrations and challenges do they encounter?
			</div>

			<div class="question-title">
				Why doesn‚Äôt the current system meet their needs?
			</div>
			<br>
			After talking to three users, here are the key insights I found‚Äî

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="step-title">
			Affinity Mapping
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
		Based on the responses I got about the current system in place, I wrote down key words that were mentioned and organized them
		into two specific categories to determine the general scope of this project and possible features I would need to include.
		</div>

			<div class="step-title">
				Pain Points
			</div>
				<div class="step-desc">
					After conducting user interviews and utilizing the affinity mapping method, I identified the key pain points which are‚Äî

									<div class="subtitle">01</div>
															The search for supplies and materials is complicated and time consuming on online marketplaces
										<div class="subtitle">02</div>
															There is no single place to look for supplies and materials

					</div>

			<div class="process-step">
				03. Ideation
			</div>
				<div class="step-title">
				Archetypes
			</div>
			<div class="step-desc">
				Based on the pain points I identified from the user interviews and affinity map, I created two user archetypes.
				They will help me keep the users in mind in this design process.

				<div class="step-title">
				Sketches
			</div>
			<div class="step-desc">
				Before commiting to the final solution, I sketched different solutions and screens that focused on the key pain points.
				I wanted to focus on creating the most efficient and user-friendly system.

			04. Prototyping
		</div>
		<div class="step-title">
			Wireframes
		</div>
		<div class="step-desc">
			From these sketches, I was able to translate them into simple wireframes.
			I was mainly concerned with creating different card layouts that best displayed the information.

						05. Reflection

					<div class="step-title">
						Lessons & Takeaways
					</div>
					<div class="step-desc">
					The most challenging part of this project was designing a system that made the most sense and was most intuitive to new users. Nonetheless,
					I enjoying having to explore many different ways of displaying the information and determining which features were the most
					important to creating a streamlined structure.
					<br>
					<br>
					If time permitted, I would look into designing further into the search filtering feature. I would want to add a more specific feature
					where users could toggle open a filter drop-down menu. In addition, I would want to look into how to allow users to post about what they‚Äôre looking to buy.
