				<div class="storyline-description">
					This year we participated in the 2020 DubsTech Protothon, an online UX hackathon.
					<br><br>
					<b>The Prompt:</b> <br><br> Design a mobile or tablet (preferred) application that allows
					nurses to seamlessly check-in new patients and communicate with patients, care providers, and rooms so there‚Äôs more time for patients and less paperwork.
					<br><br>
					<b>My Role:</b> <br><br> I conducted secondary research around our problem space and designed and prototyped the check-in assessment, patient profile, and room assignment page.

				<div class="main-step-title">What is the current state of our hospital care system?</div>
						<div class="step-description">
							With the novel coronavirus pandemic, hospitals are facing a rapid influx of patients coming in to be identified, isolated, tested, or admitted for COVID-19. This
							has led cities and hospitals to create external testing setups and temporary hospital-like camps to accommodate for this massive influx of patients.

		<div class="small-text-title">Problem</div>
		<div class="problem-title">Even with these external testing setups and temporary hospital-like camps, why is the system still struggling?</div>
				<div class="problem-description">
					Due to this overflow, front-line workers (doctors, nurses, assistants, etc.), are inevitably spending more time on paperwork which is costing them an unnecessary amount
					of time and hindering them from providing enough care to their patients.

				</div>

<div class="solution-container">

				<div class="storyline-title">The Solution</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
				We designed Care.ly to streamline the process of collecting paperwork. Through an easy step-by-step online procedure, Care.ly helps healthcare workers expedite the check-in process before patients are admitted into the hospital.
				By reducing the amount of paperwork, we increase the amount of time healthcare workers spend with their patients.

							<div class="reflection-title">Designing for a real-world issue</div>
												<div class="reflection-description">
													Most of the projects I've worked on are focused more on augmenting social good, so this project gave me a small taste of what it meant to design for impact. This concept was something that was extremely
													relevant and because it was a real-world issue, I felt more inclined to think deeply about the stakeholders involved and how this product could improve their current system.
												</div>
						<div class="reflection-title">Designing for experiences I've never related to</div>
												<div class="reflection-description">
													I loved being able to think through this problem because its something I have never related to. It was a challenge because I couldn't refer to my own experience or people in my immediate network, but it made
													this project all the more exciting. I enjoyed thinking through this tough problem in such a short time and its made me realize how important it is to talk to those who are involved. The research done
													during this project was all secondary and I definitely wish I could've talked to a real person directly involved. That would have provided much richer insights and helped me understand the goals and
													needs more holistically.
