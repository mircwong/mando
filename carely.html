				<div class="storyline-description">
					This year we participated in the 2020 DubsTech Protothon, an online UX hackathon.
					<br><br>
					<b>The Prompt:</b> <br><br> Design a mobile or tablet (preferred) application that allows
					nurses to seamlessly check-in new patients and communicate with patients, care providers, and rooms so there‚Äôs more time for patients and less paperwork.
					<br><br>
					<b>My Role:</b> <br><br> I conducted secondary research around our problem space and designed and prototyped the check-in assessment, patient profile, and room assignment page.

				<div class="main-step-title">What is the current state of our hospital care system?</div>
						<div class="step-description">
							With the novel coronavirus pandemic, hospitals are facing a rapid influx of patients coming in to be identified, isolated, tested, or admitted for COVID-19. This
							has led cities and hospitals to create external testing setups and temporary hospital-like camps to accommodate for this massive influx of patients.

<div class="problem-container">
		<div class="small-text-title">Problem</div>
		<div class="problem-title">Even with these external testing setups and temporary hospital-like camps, why is the system still struggling?</div>
				<div class="problem-description">
					Due to this overflow, front-line workers (doctors, nurses, assistants, etc.), are inevitably spending more time on paperwork which is costing them an unnecessary amount
					of time and hindering them from providing enough care to their patients.

				</div>
</div>


<div class="solution-container">
		<div class="storyline">
				<div class="storyline-title">The Solution</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
				We designed Care.ly to streamline the process of collecting paperwork. Through an easy step-by-step online procedure, Care.ly helps healthcare workers expedite the check-in process before patients are admitted into the hospital.
				By reducing the amount of paperwork, we increase the amount of time healthcare workers spend with their patients.

									<b>Takeaways</b><br><br>
									1. <i>Too much effort</i><br>
									Users expressed that it would be difficult to see each level especially while driving because they would have to press the "Change Level" button and choose a level each time.
									<br><br>

									2. <i>Unclear level change function</i><br>
									I noticed that users were confused trying to change levels as they tried to swipe on the numbers instead of click on them.

								<div class="process-description">
									<b>A/B Testing Takeaways</b><br><br>
									1. <i>Brighter red</i><br>
									We found that the red parking spot icon on the right was best because users expressed it was more vibrant, bold, and more quickly identified as an occupied space.
									<br><br>
									2. <i>Star symbol</i><br>
									We found that users thought the initial R symbol meant reserved not restricted, so we swapped it out for a star because it‚Äôs more universally known and indicated some
									kind of special status. In addition, we added an explanation of what the star meant to clarify its meaning even further.

									<b>Takeaways</b><br><br>
									1. <i>Unclear buttons</i><br>
									All users thought that the "Level 1" title was a button and tried to click it. They expressed that it looked like a button because we consistently used this pill shape throughout the rest of the app.
									<br><br>
									2. <i>No zooming in</i><br>
									I noticed that most users didn't try to click on the parking layout cards (photo on the left) because there was nothing to indicate that it was clickable.

									<b>Improvements</b><br><br>
									In the final design, I took the users' feedback and turned the "Level 1" title into a button that allowed users to hop in between levels more quickly, not having to swipe through each one.
									I did this to account for garages that may have 10 or more levels and would be too much effort to swipe through.
									<br>
									<br>
									In addition, I added a magnifying glass in the bottom right corner of each card to indicate that they could zoom in to see the level more closely.

			<div class="reflection-container">
							<div class="reflection-title">Working on a cross-functional team</div>
												<div class="reflection-description">
												This was my first time working with other designers as well as the CTO! It was really exciting for me because, I'll be honest, collaborating with people I don't already know
												is a challenge for me. It takes some time for me to get comfortable and be vulnerable sharing ideas and giving critiques. Even though it was challenging at first, it was so
												rewarding for me. I loved seeing our team dynamic evolve as time went on and getting more comfortable with each other. Working closely with Carely's CTO was also a new and exciting experience!
											 	I've never had to present my work for non-designers and throughout this process, I learned how to present my designs in a way that was understandable to someone who wasn't directly
												involved in the process and support my design decisions with evidence.
												</div>
						<div class="reflection-title">Remote collaboration</div>
												<div class="reflection-description">
												Just like everyone else, this was my first time collaborating remotely. There's definitely something about physically working around other people that I miss, but this constraint
												offered a unique opportunity to learn how to work efficiently and effectively without the proper resources/materials. I learned how to conduct usability testing and interviews through Zoom (which is
												actually not <i>as</i> terrible as you'd think). I realized how important it is to document everything you're doing and explain concepts clearly to the users you're working with.
												</div>
						<div class="reflection-title">Advocating for the end-user</div>
												<div class="reflection-description">
												Like I mentioned, usability testing is the fun part and honestly, it really was. I loved iterating on the feedback users gave and I learned how important it is to always advocate for the end-user.
												It was humbling because I was reminded that my assumptions are definitely not always right and I'm not designing for myself, but for others.
