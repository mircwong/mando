		This year we participated in the 2020 DubsTech Protothon, an online UX hackathon held by
		the University of Washington (UW). From the 3 project tracks to choose from, we decided to
		tackle the health track to design a digital product that helped alleviate the burden on healthcare
		workers during this pandemic.
		<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		Overall, this was a very collaborative and exploratory process, despite the strict time constraints.
		By the end of the weekend, we submitted an interactive prototype for judging.
		<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		We actually revisited this project after the hackathon because we wanted to do more testing to validate our
		product as well as discover any new needs or behaviors our users had.

			Given our time constraint and the limited availability of healthcare workers, we relied on secondary research to understand our problem space.

			After reading a handful of journals and reports, we were able to learn about what the current state of our hospital care system was like.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			With the novel coronavirus pandemic, hospitals are facing a rapid influx of patients coming in
			to be identified, isolated, tested, or admitted for COVID-19. This has led cities and hospitals
			to create external testing setups and temporary hospital-like camps to accommodate for this massive
			influx of patients.
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
			Due to this overflow, front-line workers (doctors, nurses, assistants, etc.), are inevitably
			spending more time on paperwork which is costing them an unnecessary amount
			of time and hindering them from providing enough care to their patients.

		Most of the projects I've worked on are focused more on augmenting social good, so this
		project gave me a small taste of what it meant to design for impact. This concept was something
		that was extremely relevant and because it was a real-world issue, I felt more inclined to think

<div class="spacing-32"></div>
		<div class="right-title">Designing for experiences I've never related to</div>
<div class="spacing-16"></div>
		I loved being able to think through this problem because its something I have never related to. It was
		a challenge because I couldn't refer to my own experience or people in my immediate network, but it made
		this project all the more exciting. I enjoyed thinking through this tough problem in such a short time and
		its made me realize how important it is to talk to those who are involved. The research done during this
		project was all secondary and I definitely wish I could've talked to a real person directly involved. That
	 	would have provided much richer insights and helped me understand the goals and needs more holistically.
